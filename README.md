# Backdoor
1)basic_backdoor.py
The provided Python code creates a basic echo server using the socket module. The server binds to the localhost (the local machine) on port 8080 and listens for incoming connections. Once a client connects, the server establishes a connection with it and sends a "Hello, world!" message to the client. The server then enters a loop to receive data from the connected client. When data is received, it decodes it from bytes to a string, prints the received message, and echoes it back to the client. This process continues until the client closes the connection or an error occurs. Once the loop ends, the server closes the connection with the client and goes back to listening for new connections. Essentially, the server acts as a simple echo service, responding with the same message it receives from each connected client. It will keep running indefinitely, processing incoming connections and their messages as they arrive.

2)backdoor_encrypted.py
This code represents a simple multi-threaded server that provides secure communication using SSL/TLS. The server listens for incoming connections on localhost at port 8080. Once a client connects, the server establishes a secure SSL/TLS connection with the client using the provided server certificate and private key (server.crt and server.key).

Upon successful SSL/TLS connection, the server sends the message "Hello, world!" to the client using the secure connection. After that, it waits to receive data from the client.

The server uses threading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously. When a new client connects, the server creates a new thread (client_thread) to handle that client's communication, allowing multiple clients to interact with the server concurrently.

The handle_client function is executed within each thread and is responsible for handling the communication with the connected client. It wraps the socket connection in an SSL context to enable secure communication, sends the "Hello, world!" message, and then waits to receive data from the client. Any exceptions that occur during the communication process are caught and handled, ensuring the server continues to operate even if some clients encounter errors.

The main server loop continuously listens for incoming connections, and for each new connection, it creates a new thread to handle the communication with that client. The server keeps running until the user interrupts it (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), at which point the server gracefully terminates and closes the socket.
